# QuantumStar Processor

## Project Overview
The QuantumStar Processor is a unique quantum computing product designed specifically for space applications. It leverages advanced quantum computing capabilities to deliver unparalleled computational power in the harsh conditions of space. The product is designed with a focus on compactness, resilience, and optimization for space conditions like radiation resistance and temperature fluctuations.

## Installation Instructions
To access and use the KiCAD files for the QuantumStar Processor, follow these steps:

1. Download the KiCAD software if you haven't already. You can get it from [here](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/).
2. Clone this repository or download the files directly.
3. Open the `Schematic.sch` and `PCB_Layout.kicad_pcb` files in KiCAD.

Please note that you need to have KiCAD installed on your system to open these files.

## Usage Guidelines
The `Schematic.sch` file contains the schematic diagram of the QuantumStar Processor, detailing all electronic and quantum components. The `PCB_Layout.kicad_pcb` file contains the PCB layout of the processor. You can modify these designs as per your requirements or implement them as is.

The design choices made in these files are optimized for space applications. For instance, the compactness and resilience of the PCB layout are crucial for space technology.
